# Inventory Forecasting Project üìä

üöÄ What is this app for?

This app is designed to help you make accurate predictions about future trends or behaviors using your time-series data.

üîç What can I do with my data?

Once you upload your CSV file, you can visualize your time-series data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build machine learning models for forecasting, and gain insights to make informed decisions.

Note: When the chatbot asks you for date and target column names make sure to provide the names as they written in the data due to case sensitivity.
